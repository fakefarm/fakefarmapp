  ✔ there are tables that were created from scaffold. when i used destroy, the tables in the db didn't delete. For example (social_networks). So I need to figure out how to delete pg tables without. Should I just add a migration or can I go into the pg console and delete the table?  @done(2017-05-11 13:05) @project(postgres) (solution was to delete the public schema)
