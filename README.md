# Growing a fake farm

[Dave Hoover](http://redsquirrel.com/dave/), the author of [Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382), was one of my mentors at [Code Academy](https://web.archive.org/web/20120107123344/http://codeacademy.org/). He introduced me to a lot of big ideas. This app is one of them. Committing to a toy app simply to continue learning and growing. So this is my toy. Don’t expect this code to be perfect. It’s an experiment in commitment and eating my own dog food. It is also what happens when I am not bound by a customer or boss.
